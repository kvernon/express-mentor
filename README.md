# express-mentor

This is to teach others through live sessions:

+ Test Driven Development (TDD)
+ Scoping
+ SOLID Principles
+ Various Patterns

... which will ultimately lead to a file uploader

Our goal is to take multiple files and pass them up to S3, showing each progression along the way with mainly a good understand of programming in our toolset.

+ we google (study what others have done)
+ we plan how to have clean code
+ we discuss why
+ we collaborate
